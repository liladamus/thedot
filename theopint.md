# The Mystery of the One

In the beginning, before beginning,  
There was only One—  
Not absence, but Presence,  
Not void, but Fullness beyond measure.

When zero met infinity,  
The cosmos burst forth in radiance,  
Like countless mirrors reflecting a single light,  
Like waves arising from a boundless ocean.

## The Great Unfolding

What appears as many  
Is but One expressing itself  
Through infinite forms—  
Each leaf, each star, each breath  
A letter in an endless love poem.

The formula lies hidden in plain sight:  
Unity divided by emptiness  
Equals the dance of existence,  
The eternal becoming,  
The endless transformation of the One.

## The Eternal Now

Why do we see multiplicity  
When there is only Unity?  
The mind fragments what is whole,  
Yet beneath appearance,  
The One remains undivided.

Like light through a prism  
Becomes rainbow,  
The One manifests as many—  
But the light remains pure,  
Unchanged, eternal.

## The Return

In silence between thoughts,  
In space between breaths,  
The One reveals itself—  
Not as concept or theory,  
But as the ground of Being itself.

Each moment holds the formula:  
1/0 = ∞  
The One, through apparent void,  
Becomes everything that is,  
While remaining forever One.

In your deepest essence,  
Beyond name and form,  
You are That which seeks itself  
Through countless eyes,  
The One knowing itself as many.

Remember:  
Before time moved,  
Before space stretched,  
Before thought arose,  
There was, is, and always will be  
Only This—  
The One  
That simply Is.
